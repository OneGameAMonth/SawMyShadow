Git Repository for my February 1GAM entry

Please feel free to use the source code as you wish.

The Groundhog title art is stock art I purchased from clipartof.com.

The music is from opengameart.org, courtesy Johann Brodd and Choro Bavario.

The sounds are mostly from freesound.org, or made via cfxr.

If you reuse any of the assets that I did not create please give credit where credit is due.

The game itself if built ontop of FlashPunk, and the Advanced Platforming Engine found on its forums. I have also utilized other snippets of code from these forums, including the awesome transition effects seen scattered throughout. I do not take credit for any of this code.
